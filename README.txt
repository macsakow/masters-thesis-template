1. Introduction
The provided template may be used by anyone willing to write his/her thesis on Gdańsk University of Technology using LaTeX. It is generally compatible with formatting described in Appendix No. 2 to GUT Rector's Decree No. 49/2014, 5 December 2014. There are some exceptions that will be described further in this README. The template was prepared for writing thesis in English, but it may be easily converted for writing in Polish by adding necessary commands to a preamble (author haven't checked what need to be added but probably only babel package for hypenations etc. and maybe some customization for Polish names like Spis treści, Bibliografia etc. - look into gutthesis.sty for places where English names had to be put manually). More information about internationalization in LaTeX may be found for example here: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Internationalization#Polish. Polish letters in document should work "out of the box" as input encoding is set to utf8 and font encoding to T1.

2. Usage
If you plan to use provided template first download your thesis title page and statement from MyGUT https://moja.pg.gda.pl/ and save them in files TitlePage.pdf and Statement.pdf respectively. Now you may write your thesis by editing Thesis.tex and files in tex subfolder. In Thesis.tex put content of your thesis in places where \input commands are issued. The rest is just standard LaTeX. Remember only to put figures into figure environment and tables into table environment and everything should work fine and automatically.

3. Formatting incompatibilities
List below presents formatting incompatibilities of provided template and formatting described in Appendix No. 2 to GUT Rector's Decree No. 49/2014, 5 December 2014. Some of them were due to LaTeX limitations (or too much time needed to apply those rules) and some because of good typesetting rules.
There are following incompatibilities:
 - Title of appendix in Table of Contents - according to requirements there is no name of appendix in table of contents (in the example ToC provided by GUT), but the default behaviour of LaTeX is to put names in ToC. As appendices are actually chapters it's hard to configure them in different manner than other chapters thus appendices' names are put into ToC. You may manually put empty titles in ToC by specifying empty alternative chapter name for appendix to be put into ToC (see appendix B),
 - Font - requirements specify that Arial should be used. As using Arial in LaTeX is not so easy, Helvetica was used. Helvetica has the same sizes as Arial and people who don't know much about typography won't see a difference in font shapes,
 - Table headers should be repeated on subsequent pages - as the text in table should have different font size (9 pt. instead of 10 pt. of the document) and spaces configuration around them, it has been done for table floating environment, but long tables are not put into this environment thus font change and proper spacing won't be done automatically. It is probably possible to configure it to happen automatically, but author had no need for long tables for now so it was not implemented (maybe in the future),
 - Chapter titles don't have top margin of 12 pt - it is actually the behaviour of MS Word to strip additional spaces before/after paragraph/title if it's the first/last element on the page so text on the page is aligned to top/bottom margin. This behaviour was also implemented here, because it is actually good practice and looks better than with additional space,
 - Bibliography style - requirements are really ambiguous as it doesn't specify any information about how titles should be formatted and only provide some examples, so it was totally ignored and standard LaTeX unsrt style was used (entries are numbered and sorted in order they appear in thesis),
 - Dot after appendix number instead of colon - as described above appendices are actually chapters thus it's hard to treat them differently than chapter thus they get the same style as chapters i.e. dot after number,
 - Appendices' titles are formatted in the same manner as chapters - requirements are again ambiguous as in the examples appendices' titles are formatted in some way not described anywhere thus for the reasons above it's again formatted in the same way as chapters.
