\chapter*{Abstract}

The \textbf{Abstract} should include a definition of the scientific or practical problem to be solved, the aim and scope of the thesis, the applied methods of research, the results and the most important conclusions.

If the thesis is written by more than one author, the \textbf{Abstract} must specify what each author has prepared and contributed. Moreover, the particular authorship of each chapter and subchapter must also be specified (see \textbf{Table of Contents}). If a writer is named as the author of a particular subchapter it should be assumed that all the items in the subchapter are the work of that particular writer. For example, if the thesis is co-authored by writer A and writer B, in the Table of Contents it may be stated that writer A co-authored chapters 1 and 7, individually authored chapter 2 as well as subchapters 3.1 and 4.2, etc. A writer B, on turn, may be named as the co-author of chapters 1 and 7 as well as the individual author of subchapters 3.2 and 4.1, etc.
